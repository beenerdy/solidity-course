# SimpleStorage Solidity Contract

This is a basic Solidity smart contract called `SimpleStorage` that I'm using to learn Solidity and smart contract development.

## Features

- Store and retrieve a number
- Add a person with their name and favorite number

## How it works

- `store`: Save a number to the blockchain.
- `retrieve`: Get the saved number.
- `addPerson`: Add a person with their name and favorite number to a list.

I'm experimenting with Solidity to get a better understanding of how smart contracts work!
